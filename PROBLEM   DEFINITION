 PROBLEM   DEFINITION
While QR Codes are quite the sturdy technology and are easy to read with any smartphone, sometimes improper designs can render them unscannable.
There are things to look out for such as colour mismatches, materials the QR Code will be used on, its size, and more. 
QR code are the most normalized and growing technologies in this techno world, but people are unable to understand about the QR code wisely. 
Some QR code has pixel issues like when we scan the code, we’re unable to get the information that is compressed in the QR code.
Here we ‘ve outlined the most common QR Code scanning problems and how they can be resolved.
The ideal size would be if the QR Code is at minimum four times larger than the width of your QR Code modules. 
When in original form, the modules are the black pixels that make up the QR Code (or also come in colour when customized). 
The more data that you add to a QR Code, the smaller those pixels will become.	
Describe how the QR code generated with a step-by-step implementation, what types of files can be converted into QR code and clear vision about QR code.
In our project we present you a more valid and clear code that gives you the information that the code contains in it within a fraction of seconds.
